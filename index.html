            <p>
              The hole point of starting this up is so as to open the eyes of every person in the world to homelessness and the stigma given to homeless people the hole world over. I plan to take five to ten homeless people to country's all over the world to help out homeless people and to show them that even doe we are homeless here in Ireland that we dont have it half as bad as some people do in other country's that some places dont have a system in place like we do no mater how bad it is.

            <p>
              Also i want people to take away the stigma that has been put on all homeless people that !!We are all addicts or alcoholics or have some sort of medical condition!! this is not the case and i will prove it too you. I for one am none of these things and yet iv been homeless most of my adult life i am 33 now and started this nonprofit organisation too show how the homeless can and will show change given the chance. There is good in all humans even more so in those who have nothing. Just because a person is homeless it doesn't mean there a bad person you give them a chance and they can shine brighter than any star in the sky or on your TV
